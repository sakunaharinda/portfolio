    content: |-
      Hi there! I'm a final year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Auckland, where I’m researching human-centric cybersecurity. My focus is on developing AI techniques, particularly natural language processing (NLP) and GenAI, to translate high-level requirements into enforceable access control policies. I’m also dedicated to making cybersecurity systems more usable, ensuring people interact with them effectively and make fewer mistakes.

      Before diving into academia, I worked as a software engineer at H2O.ai, building cutting-edge AI applications and developing robust testing frameworks. Prior to that, I was a backend engineer at ADL, crafting APIs with Java and Spring Boot.

      I’m passionate about creating AI-driven solutions that bridge the gap between humans and technology. Outside of work, you’ll find me playing chess, enjoying cricket, or brainstorming my next big idea.
